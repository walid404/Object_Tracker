# Object_Tracker
This project is a real-time object tracker designed to accurately track selected objects from a live camera feed with high efficiency and minimal latency. 

---

## Project Details
### In this project I have used:
1. **OpenCV** to accuratly capture and process the video from **Webcam**.
2. **selectROI** from **OpenCV** to draw box arround the selected object.
3. **TrackerCSRT** from **OpenCV** to accurately track selected object from **Webcam** in real-time.

---

### Project Structure
1. **ObjectTracker** (Class) - Manages the entire object tracking process, including selection and real-time tracking.
2. **select_object** (Function) - Opens the camera, allowing users to manually select the most suitable frame for object selection instead of using the first frame. Press **S** to capture the desired frame.
3. **run_tracker** (Function) - Tracks the selected object in real time through the camera and stops when the user presses **Q**.

### Run Project Workflow
1. Open the webcam using the ```cv2.VideoCapture(0)``` function.
2. Display the frames until user press on **S** key to annotated the object he want to track.
3. Annotated the object which we want to track using ```cv2.selectROI()``` function.
4. Pass the anntation to tracking object and track the object until the object disappear or user quit by pressing on **Q** key.
